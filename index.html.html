    <h1>Dear Yanis,</h1>
    <p> The past few days have been really hard not having you around. I want to make things better which may seem impossible to you but not to me. I want to show you how devoted i am to do absolutely anything in this world for you and to make you feel loved. I think about your sweet face every night, your laugh, how when you smile one side of your mouth lifts up more than the other and your pretty eyes. I love you with all my heart but, i feel cursed, i feel like the most terrible person in the world. I think to myself “ What have i done? Why did i do those things?” and i don’t even have an answer for myself. I guess i’m cursed with being stupid. I just want you to come back to me. I want us, i want what we had. I will show it to you, not only with words but with actions. I don’t want this with anyone else, i don’t ever want this connection with anyone else. I don’t see our time as wasted at all, i see it as something to look back on and see how we’ve evolved and grown from. I truly think you’re my soulmate, actually i know you are. Id like to think as well as being cursed i’m also gifted with something, which is knowing who is the right person to me. I see signs, i feel them, the universe tells me them. I may sound like a complete weirdo right now but i’ve always had a very strong intuition and emotional side as you may know, but the universe never fails to tell me its you on more than one occasion. I was stuck where you are right now, i thought nothing would never change, nothing would get better with you. But then, life started getting more gentle, the universe told me it was you and that made me stop. It made every single doubt in my head go away. It made me know i was loved and i had someone to love. I had found my person. I know that if you give me another chance it will definitely be the last one. So lets make a different ending together, the ending where we live together with Jules, Julia and Francene and our little pet tortoise and maybe our cat named mug... The ending where we’re happy and love each other endlessly. I feel inexplicable amounts of regret and pain in my head. You are truly the only person on this whole world that understands me, not even my closest friend understands me after years of knowing her, yet when something changes in my mood, you instantly know what’s wrong. You know how to listen to me. Nobody else cares for my feelings as much as you do, nobody ever said they were proud of me before you did. You touched my heart with all your love and now i can say that i feel it. I see your love with my eyes and i feel it inside of my skin and bones. So i wanted to make this really shitty website for you to show my love in actions. I probably look like a complete fool but id rather be your fool than anyone else’s. I’d rather say all my cheesy things to you than keep them inside. Your gracefulness will no longer go unnoticed as long as you have me around, id write silly little things about you all the time. In fact, i already do that. As my first action, i made you this really shitty website. So, for the rest of this website i'd like to share with you the notes i write in my journal that i write when i miss you, some songs that make me think about you and lastly some of my thoughts. </p>

<p2> ps: i have no idea how to make pages i tried my best but you're just going to have to scroll...</p2>

<body> <h1>
Journal ( be warned its cheesy)
</h1>
<p> I'll spare you and only put in 2 days of my journal because it's quite long... </p>

<p3>It's been a few days since it happened. That phone call we had yesterday meant so much to me. I didn't wanna have to leave. He told me he promised he'd be there when I'm ready. I don't know how long that will take but all i know is that in the end it will be worth it to have my angel again. I didn't understand how i felt. But i know that deep down in my heart we are meant to be. I was so hurt when i called him. I  dont understand why or how he could ever still care about me. The promise he made me is the only thing that keeps me going. I have doubts if he meant it or not... I miss how simple things used to be, myself,him, us and life.. Everything feels so strange now. I dont even have anyone to hold my hand through  it. It makes me sad how i find myself alone again but i guess thats just how things are. All i ever wanted was to feel love and appreciation. I never asked to get hurt. But we can't always get what we want. I just want somebody to awknowledge what im doing and the only person that makes me feel that way is him. I hope you keep your promise, it means a lot to me.
</p3>
<p>
<p4> I missed you a lot today. I cried because i miss you. I hope you won't talk to anyone else. I notice you unblocked me. I still look at your reposts
    even though you dont look at mine. I hope you feel how much i miss you. I've been laying in bed all day thinking about your face, it's all i see 
    when i close my eyes. I miss you. Do you miss me? I get so jealous thinking if girls are talking to you because you're my baby. You know i want you and i promised that.
    I remember you said you'd message me about a week before school. I hate having to wait to talk to my favourite person. I'm waiting for that day to talk
    to you. I'm already thinking about how we're going to look at eachother when we pass by in the hallway. I know you'll probably not even look my way
    but i'll always be watching you. I just wanna look at your face again. I miss you. I want you. I need you. I could write i miss you 100 times
    and it still wouldnt be enough to express what i'm feeling.

<body> <h1>
Why i am so in love with you</h1>

<p>I love you so much and you will always hold a very special place in my heart. I think of you before i go to sleep and when i wake up. I can't even escape you
    in my dreams because you're also in them. I'm so proud of you and i hold so much love for you in my heart. I long to have you in my life as my soulmate and i enjoy making all 
    of these things for you to show you how dearly i care. I want us to be able to love eachother sweetly again. I want to kiss you, to hug you, to hold you and to stare
    into your pretty brown eyes. This isn't a chore for me this is me, showing my love to my baby. You will always be my baby and i am forever yours sweetie.
    A life without you, isn't a bright one. My stars don't shine without you and my lungs can't breathe without the oxygen you give me. You are the reason
    why i aspire to be better. You are my love and the one that keeps me going and keeps me happy. Nobody in this whole universe could ever take your place
    nor hold a place so close to my heart. Yes i do still love your stinky burps and farts.I want to suffocate you with my love. You're my lover and my best friend. You are my world. My heart loves everything about you and i could
    go on and on about it.I hope this is somewhat meaningful to you and i really hope you like it...I hope this wasn't a waste of your time this 
    took me over 3 hours... ( Yes, i do still suck at coding)
